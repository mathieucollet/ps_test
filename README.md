# Procsea Test Api
Test creating an API With Django

### Time spent
~ 6 hours

### No had time for
- Build some tests
- Optimization

###  Is still buggy
Some state records do not have match the Nominatim API, possibly due to the renaming of some states since 2016

### Can be improved
Almost everything can be improved because it's been 2 years that I have not practiced Python or Django. However, I sought to have a clear code, which follows conventions and good practices

### What happened
I spent a lot of my time on the CSV import script. I had never really handled CSV so far, so I had to do quite a bit of research.

In my previous experiences with Django, I had not created APIs, so I just relied on the documentation of Django and Django Rest Framework


### My feelings
I am satisfied with the final result, which I believe meets the proposed test. 

I encountered difficulties on the creation of the script, mainly on the manipulation of the CSV.

I also wonder a lot about how I included the sums and the coordinates for each states, to know if there was better to do or more effective.
